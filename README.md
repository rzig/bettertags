# Bettertags

`bettertags` is an enhanced version of the [`mkdocs-material` built-in tags plugin](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/tags) with FREE versions of all Insiders-only tags features, and some minor improvements.

This plugin is originally based on the MIT-licensed source from `mkdocs-material`, but many parts have been heavily refactored/rewritten (and weren't written without any knowledge of the Material Insiders source). If you have suggestions of extra enhancements, please open an issue.

## Installation and usage

1. Run `pip install bettertags`
2. Replace the `tags` configruation option of your `mkdocs.yml` with `bettertags`
3. If you use Material-provided functions for `tags_compare` or `tags_pages_compare`, replace `material.plugins.tags` with `bettertags`

You can now use any insiders-only features [described in the Material docs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/tags). I've also added a features to `tags_extra_files`, described below.

## `tags_extra_files`

Use this option to add additional tag lists to your wiki:

```
plugins:
  - bettertags:
      tags_extra_files:
        extra-1.md: [allowed-tag-1, allowed-tag-2, ...]
        extra-2.md: "*subfolder"
        extra-3.md: "*"
        "folder/extra-4.md":
            - rule: "*subfolder"
            - priority: 3
```

Each tag index can have one of the following types of rules:

- `[allowed-tag-1, ...]`: only include tags from the given list
- `*subfolder`: only include tags and pages from files contained within the same parent folder (or any descendants) as this index
- `*`: include all tags and pages

An index may also have an associated priority. By default, all extra indexes have priority `0`, and the primary index (from `tags_file` option) has priority `1`. When a tag on a wiki page is linked back to a tag index, it is linked to the index with the highest priority that contains the page. By default, this means a tag will always link back to the primary tags index. In the above example, pages in `folder/` will have tags linking to `folder/extra-4.md`, since `folder/` has a priority `3 > 1`. It is considered _undefined behavior_ to have multiple indexes that _tie_ for having the _highest priority_ for a given page/tag pair.

`tags_extra_files` can also be replaced with `indexes` in your config for improved clarity.
